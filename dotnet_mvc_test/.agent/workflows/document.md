Document Creation Guidelines

Code examples: Keep minimal—show only essential snippets. Omit entirely when the concept is clear without code.
Directory trees: Never include—I can inspect the filesystem myself.
ASCII diagrams: Use sparingly for complex relationships (architecture, data flow, state transitions). Avoid when prose suffices.
